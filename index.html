        <h3>About Mike </h3>

        <p>
          I grew up in Bowling Green, a small farm town in northeast Missouri. I'm a 50-year-old father with two kids
          (ages 19 & 22) and one wife (so far). Amy and I have been together since high school, so I'm liking my odds
          :). I've lived in Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa. I've been a grocery store bagger, driven dump trucks
          and backhoes for a city street department, organized youth sports and other programs at a YMCA and summer
          camps, interned at a municipal recreation department, and graduated with a BS in Parks and Recreation
          Management with some computer courses. After graduation, I spent time as an EMT, a short time working as a
          community support person for people with mental illness, and 2 weeks as a furniture salesman.
        </p>

        <p>
          I graduated in 1994 with a BS in Recreation Management. I began my IT career in 1998 at the St. Louis Public
          Library. I was sucked into the dot com bubble. I was hired to install computers after Bill Gates donated $1.2
          million to the library for modernizing their technology. After a few weeks, my job duties expanded to include
          helping configure LAN and WAN networks, and I was introduced to computer and network security. I moved with
          Amy to Iowa City in August 1999 when she started the Ph.D. program in the Management and Entrepreneurship
          department at Tippie.
        </p>

        <p>
          After moving to Iowa City, I spent time working as a contractor doing phone tech support for McCleod USA
          salespeople. Within a few months, I landed at Kinze Manufacturing, where I worked for several years. I worked
          as a network and system administrator and was involved in several significant projects and system
          implementations. After Amy's graduation in 2004, she started teaching at the University of Notre Dame. The
          first year in Indiana, I was a stay at home dad, and then I started teaching as an adjunct in Fall 2005 at the
          University of Notre Dame. In 2007 we landed back at the University of Iowa. Beginning in fall 2007, I started
          teaching as an adjunct lecturer in the Business Analytics department (formerly Management Sciences) here at
          Tippie. In Fall 2010, I moved to a full-time lecturer, and in spring 2019, I was promoted to Associate
          Professor of Practice. I graduated with my Master's in Software Development in May 2021 from Maryville
          University.
